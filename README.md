# DES
DES is based on the two fundamental attributes of cryptography: 
substitution (also called confusion) and transposition (also called diffusion). 
DES consists of 16 steps, each of which is called a round. 
Each round performs the steps of substitution and transposition.
Here is the code for implementation of DES in C++.
